# Moringa-Core-Statistics


We have been tasked to understand electric car usage. We will work as a Data Scientist for the Autolib electric car-sharing service company to investigate a claim about the blue cars from the provided Autolib dataset.
The Data Science team will conduct research and provide recommendations on the strategy to distribute their resources by responding to the following claim:
  
  
  
  On a given weekday, the number of BlueCars taken is more than the total combined number of Utilib and Utilib_14 cars taken.
  
  
  The dataset and glossary to use for this project can be found here [columns_explanation.xlsx](https://github.com/esther-nyokabi/Moringa-Core-Statistics/files/9841475/columns_explanation.xlsx) and here [autolib_daily_events_postal_code.csv](https://github.com/esther-nyokabi/Moringa-Core-Statistics/files/9841491/autolib_daily_events_postal_code.csv) Links to an external site.respectively.


The provided dataset is a daily aggregation, by date and postal code, of the number of events on the Autolib network (car-sharing and recharging).
